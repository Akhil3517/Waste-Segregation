## ðŸ“‹ Quick Steps to Deploy to Railway

### **Step 1: Prepare Your Repository**

1. **Make sure your backend is ready:**
   - âœ… `main.py` has production settings
   - âœ… `requirements.txt` exists
   - âœ… `Procfile` exists
   - âœ… `runtime.txt` exists

2. **Commit your changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 2: Deploy to Railway**

1. **Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. **Sign up/Login** with your GitHub account
3. **Click "New Project"**
4. **Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"**
5. **Choose your repository** (smart-sort)
6. **Select the backend folder** or deploy the whole repo
7. **Click "Deploy"**

### **Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**

After deployment, go to your Railway project dashboard:

1. **Click on your deployed service**
2. **Go to "Variables" tab**
3. **Add these environment variables:**

```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
DB_NAME=smart_waste_segregation
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_here
```

### **Step 4: Get Your Railway URL**

1. **In Railway dashboard**, click on your service
2. **Copy the generated URL** (e.g., `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)
3. **This is your production backend URL**

### **Step 5: Update Mobile App**

1. **Update `SmartWasteSortApp/src/config/api.js`:**
```javascript
// Change this line:
const CURRENT_ENV = ENV.PRODUCTION;

// Update the production URL:
const API_URLS = {
  [ENV.DEVELOPMENT]: 'http://192.168.0.101:5000',
  [ENV.PRODUCTION]: 'https://your-app-name.railway.app', // Your Railway URL
  [ENV.STAGING]: 'https://your-staging-backend.railway.app',
};
```

2. **Build new APK:**
```bash
cd SmartWasteSortApp
npx react-native run-android --variant=release
```
